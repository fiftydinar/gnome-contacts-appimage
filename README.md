> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This AppImage depends on the host `evolution-data-server` to work properly, so it's more complicated for external packaging, so I won't bother anymore with it's packaging.
> If that whole package is required to be on the host, than I would resort to using a native package instead.
> Same also applies for Gnome Calendar AppImage.
